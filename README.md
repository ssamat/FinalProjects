## Welcome to Shay Samat's GitHub Portfolio!

Hello! My name is Shay Samat, and I'm thrilled to have you here at my GitHub portfolio. This repository showcases a collection of final projects I have completed during my time at UC San Diego. Within these projects, you'll find a diverse array of disciplines that I'm deeply passionate about, including Machine Learning, Data Science, and Brain Computer Interfaces.

# About Me

I am a motivated and curious individual with a strong background in machine learning methods and a keen interest in cutting-edge technologies. Throughout my academic journey, I've dedicated myself to exploring the fascinating intersections of technology and human experiences, seeking to leverage technology's potential for making a positive impact on our world.

# What You'll Find Here

In this repository, you'll discover a carefully curated selection of projects, each representing the culmination of my efforts in different courses. These group projects I have been a part of combine technical expertise with creative problem-solving to develop solutions that go beyond theory and deliver tangible results.

# Project Highlights

* **COGS 108 Data Science in Practice**:
The goal of our project was to see if there is evidence that a minimalist logo redesign has any effect on companies. Our research question asked if there is a statistically positive correlation between a tech company logo redesign and its company stock value.
* **COGS 109 Modeling and Data Analysis**:
Air traffic delays cause people to miss events and be left waiting longer than they can afford to, impacting their lives and the reputation of different airlines. In order to make traveling much more efficient for people, we want to be able to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not based on several factors, such as the distance traveled by the flight, the origin and destination of the flight, and the carrier company of the flight. By predicting delay status, airlines can take measures to minimize disruptions and improve customer satisfaction. With this project, we aim to optimize airline operations, allocate resources efficiently, and provide better customer service.
* **COGS 118A Supervised Machine Learning Models**:
This was a final group project for the UC San Diego Course, COGS 118A: Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether an HB-1 visa will get certified or denied based on the company sponsoring the applicant. We used machine learning models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM to build a predictive model that can classify H1-B applications based on the sponsoring company. The success of our models was measured by using F1 score and ROC-AUC with accuracy calculated for comparison purposes.
* **COGS 138 Neural Data Science**: This was a group project for the course COGS 138: Neural Data Science. Our research study aimed to investigate whether EEG data can provide a reliable measure of emotional responses by distinguishing between playing a video game and watching a video clip. We utilized SVM models to train and evaluate the accuracies of two datasets: the video clip data and the video game data.
* **COGS 189 Brain Computer Interfaces**:
This is a group project for COGS 189: Brain Computer Interfaces. In this project, we used an EEG-based BCI to collect data on a social media userâ€™s brain activity while they are viewing various forms of content on Reddit. This content elicits various emotional responses and we want to investigate the relationship between brain responses and the underlying emotion of the presented content. We want to use this project as an opportunity to collect our data, as social media has become a significant part of our everyday lives and is well-integrated with society. We conducted this study on one of our group members and used the software OpenBCI to record this data.
